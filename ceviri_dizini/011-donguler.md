## 2.5. Loops

There are three types of loops in bash. `for`, `while` and `until`.

Different `for` Syntax:
```bash
for x := 1 to 10 do
begin
  statements
end

for name [in list]
do
  statements that can use $name
done

for (( initialisation ; ending condition ; update ))
do
  statements...
done
```

`while` Syntax:
```bash
while condition; do
  statements
done
```

`until` Syntax:
```bash
until condition; do
  statements
done
```
