# 4. Debugging
You can easily debug the bash script by passing different options to `bash` command. For example `-n` will not run commands and check for syntax errors only. `-v` echo commands before running them. `-x` echo commands after command-line processing.

```bash
bash -n scriptname
bash -v scriptname
bash -x scriptname
```
