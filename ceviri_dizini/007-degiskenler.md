## 2.1. Variables

Creating variables in bash is similar to other languages. There are no data types. A variable in bash can contain a number, a character, a string of characters, etc. You have no need to declare a variable, just assigning a value to its reference will create it.

Example:
```bash
str="hello world"
```

The above line creates a variable `str` and assigns "hello world" to it. The value of variable is retrieved by putting the `$` in the beginning of variable name.

Example:
```bash
echo $str   # hello world
```

Like other languages bash has also arrays. An array is variable containing multiple values. There's no maximum limit on the size of array. Array in bash are zero based. The first element is indexed with element 0. There are several ways for creating arrays in bash. Which are given below.

Examples:
```bash
array[0] = val
array[1] = val
array[2] = val
array=([2]=val [0]=val [1]=val)
array=(val val val)
```
To display a value at specific index use following syntax:

```bash
${array[i]}     # where i is the index
```

If no index is supplied, array element 0 is assumed. To find out how many values there are in the array use the following syntax:

```bash
${#array[@]}
```

Bash has also support for the ternary conditions. Check some examples below.

```bash
${varname:-word}    # if varname exists and isn't null, return its value; otherwise return word
${varname:=word}    # if varname exists and isn't null, return its value; otherwise set it word and then return its value
${varname:+word}    # if varname exists and isn't null, return word; otherwise return null
${varname:offset:length}    # performs substring expansion. It returns the substring of $varname starting at offset and up to length characters
```
